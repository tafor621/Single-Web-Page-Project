     <h2>About The Cheeseburger</h2>
     <p>A cheeseburger is a hamburger topped with cheese. Traditionally, the slice of cheese is placed on top of the meat patty. The cheese is usually added to the cooking hamburger patty shortly before serving, which allows the cheese to melt. Cheeseburgers can include variations in structure, ingredients and composition.

    <h2>Why You Should Eat a Cheeseburger</h2>
    <p>The beautiful symphony that is a cheeseburger is packed with rich flavor and will leave you FULL. These things do not play around when it comes to deliciousness. First, we got the bun, slightly toasted, but just the right amount of warmth and softness. Then comes the sauce, the sauce behind the scenes really makes everything go smoothly together as well as having a large variety in what defines a sauce that can go on a cheeseburger. Next is the Lettuce and Tomato, you count them both as one because of how well they go with eachother and they are both vegetable-like. The cold, juicy tomato compliments the lettuce like they were made for eachother (they probably were). Next is the cheese part, the cheese part really just finishes it off by melting to the perfect consistency on top of a steamy patty. And last but sure as heck not least, the one, the only, the patty. A nice savory beef patty is the core component for a cheeseburger, or any burger as a whole. All of these incredible life-changing ingredients create what you now know as, The Cheeseburger. </p>
